## 🚀 **Replit Prompt for HeartHeal Viral Features**

```
I'm building HeartHeal - a breakup song generator web app. I need you to implement 
the following features for quick launch:

CURRENT SETUP:
- Users can write their breakup story OR upload a chat screenshot
- 5 modes: Sad, Savage, Healing, Vibe, Meme
- ElevenLabs Music API generates songs from text prompts
- Tech stack: [specify: React/Next.js/whatever you're using]

FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT:

1. ANALYSIS SCREEN (the  chat upload,should have this extra details in its analysis screen)
   - Show loading animation with text: "Analyzing your conversation..."
   - Display for 3-5 seconds:
     ```
     🚩 Red flag level: [High/Medium/Low]
     💔 Heartbreak intensity: [X/10]
     🎵 Recommended vibe: [Suggested mode]
     
     Generating your personalized breakup anthem...
     ```
   - Use simple sentiment analysis or just randomize for MVP
   - Then proceed to song generation


1. Take the generated lyrics
2. Create canvas with:
   - Static gradient background (pink/purple)
   - Animated text showing lyrics line by line
   - Song title at top
   - "HeartHeal" watermark at bottom
3. Sync lyrics to audio timestamps
4. Export as MP4 (using ffmpeg or similar)
   
 
3. UX IMPROVEMENTS:
   - Add character counter to story textarea: "0/500" that updates live
   - After screenshot upload, show small preview thumbnail
   - Add one-line examples under each mode icon:
     * Sad: "Why wasn't I enough?"
     * Savage: "Your loss, my glow-up"
     * Healing: "I'm better without you"
     * Vibe: "It is what it is"
     * Meme: "Red flags? I collected them all"


4. FIRST-TIME USER EXPERIENCE:
   - First song is completely FREE (no watermark, no payment)
   - After song plays, show modal:
     "Love your song? Get unlimited songs for $9/month"
     [Subscribe] [Maybe Later]
   - Track in localStorage: hasGeneratedFirstSong = true


SKIP FOR NOW (v2 features):
- Don't implement actual chat screenshot analysis yet
- Don't do side-by-side chat + lyrics display
- Don't blur names in screenshots
- No user accounts/login for first song generation which should be just 20 sec, full song + more song should require singup with google
  we will implement the google auth with supabase + drizzle/orm but lets skip for now and implement other feautures

Please provide clean, production-ready code with comments.
Focus on making it work fast and look good on mobile.
make sure it is mobile responsive please
