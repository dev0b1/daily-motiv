Create a responsive, production-ready web app using Next.js and Tailwind CSS for a viral "Breakup Song Generator". Build the full flow including subscription tiers and Paddle payment integration. Do not include placeholders — generate the components, pages, and payment flow scaffolding as fully as possible.

App flow:

1. Landing / Home Page:
   - Header: "💔 Turn Your Breakup Into a Song 🎵"
   - Subheader: "Personalized AI breakup songs you can share, laugh, or cry to"
   - Main CTA button: "Create My Song"
   - Animated illustration: broken heart with floating musical notes (CSS animation)
   - Mobile-first, responsive layout
   - Rounded, friendly fonts
   - Soft heartbreak palette: pale red, white, gray

2. Story Input / Style Selection Page:
   - Text area input: "Tell your breakup story in a sentence or two"
   - Style selection: radio buttons or icon selection for Sad, Savage, Healing
   - "Generate Song" button triggers AI song generation animation
   - Loading animation: spinning musical notes or animated heart

3. Song Preview / Export / Subscription Page:
   - Play 10-second preview of generated song
   - Export full song (paid)
   - Subscription tiers baked in:
       - Standard: $9/month → 5 full songs
       - Premium: $19/month → 15–20 full songs + AI breakup advice + no-contact tips
   - Payment via Paddle (integrated checkout for subscriptions and per-song payments)
   - Social share buttons: TikTok, Instagram, WhatsApp
   - Upsell message: "Unlock advice & no-contact guidance with Premium"

4. Footer:
   - About AI
   - Privacy
   - FAQ
   - TikTok / social proof gallery

Requirements:
- Fully navigable flow: Landing → Story Input → Song Preview / Export
- Smooth animations for loading states and song generation
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Functional Paddle checkout integration with latest paddle billing integration for subscriptions and single song purchases
- Audio playback component for song preview and full song
- Mobile-first, responsive design
- Social share buttons fully functional (link sharing)
- Include comments in code for integrating ElevenLabs Music API for song generation

Generate the **full Next.js scaffold**, including:
- pages (`index.js`, `story.js`, `preview.js`)
- components (`Header`, `Footer`, `StyleSelector`, `SongPlayer`, `SubscriptionCTA`, `LoadingAnimation`, `SocialShareButtons`)
- Tailwind CSS setup
- Paddle integration code
- Animations (CSS or framer-motion)
- Fully functional buttons and layout
- No placeholders — ready to plug in ElevenLabs API keys

The app should be ready, testable with Paddle sandbox keys, and visually match the viral, emotional breakup song concept.
