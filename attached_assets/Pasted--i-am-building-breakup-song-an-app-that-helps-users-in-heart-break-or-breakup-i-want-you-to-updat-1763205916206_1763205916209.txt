
i am building breakup song an app that helps users in heart break or breakup , i want you to update the landing page/home page to be 
more appealing instead of how empty it is currently, change name of app from breakup song to HeartHeal

Build a high-conversion landing page and onboarding experience for a web app called “Breakup song”.

Breakup Studio instantly generates emotionally tailored breakup songs using AI music + personalized lyrics.

### GOALS
- Hit users emotionally in the first 3 seconds.
- Make them feel seen, understood, and relieved.
- Push them directly into generating their first song.
- Focus the page on outcomes, not features.
- Zero complexity. Clear, bold, emotional.

### LANDING PAGE STRUCTURE

1. **Hero Section**
   - Big headline with emotional punch:
     “Heartbroken? Turn your pain into a song that heals.”
   - Sub-headline:
     “Instant AI songs that say what you wish you could — sad, savage, healing, or funny.”
   - Single call-to-action button:
     “Create My Song”
   - Add small text under CTA:
     “Takes 10 seconds. No account needed.”

2. **Emotional Hook Section (Why this helps)**
   - Short, raw copy:
     “Breakups hurt. Overthinking hurts. Missing someone hurts. 
     Breakup Studio gives you emotional release — a personalized soundtrack for your situation.”
   - Show 4 mini-cards representing modes: Sad, Savage, Healing, Meme.

3. **Social Proof Section**
   - Use generic placeholders but Replit should build it:
     - “17,000+ songs generated this week”
     - “Shared in 40+ countries”
     - “90% of users feel better after their first song”

4. **How It Works (Simple Steps)**
   - Step 1: Tell us your vibe or story (optional).
   - Step 2: Choose your mode.
   - Step 3: Get your personal AI song + lyrics.
   - Step 4: Download or share.

5. **Benefits Section**
   - Focus on outcomes:
     - “Stop overthinking.”
     - “Get closure without texting your ex.”
     - “Laugh again.”
     - “Turn pain into creativity.”

6. **Pricing Teaser**
   - Do NOT show full pricing here. Just a teaser:
     “Your first song is free. Premium gives you unlimited songs + fast generation.”

7. **Footer**
   - Simple, clean.

### ONBOARDING FLOW (Post-CTA)

When user clicks “Create My Song,” open a modal or onboarding wizard:

**Step 1: Emotional Check-in**
Prompt text:
"How are you feeling right now?"
Options:
- Heartbroken
- Angry / Savage
- Healing
- Missing Them
- I Just Need a Laugh

**Step 2: Optional Story Input**
Prompt:
"Tell us anything that will help the AI write your song. (Or skip.)"

**Step 3: Choose Mode**
Show 5 big cards:
- Sad
- Savage
- Healing
- Vibe
- Meme

**Step 4: Generate Song**
Show a loading animation with emotional supportive messages like:
- "You’re not alone."
- "Turning your pain into music..."
- "This won’t last forever."

### STYLE
Do NOT over-explain. Let the UI feel modern, emotional, calm, soft gradients, bold typography. Replit can handle the visuals.

### REQUIREMENTS
- No placeholders that look unfinished — generate usable temporary UI components.
- CTA visible uninterrupted across the page.
- Keep everything performant and responsive.

also for the openrouter model use mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct:free  and the ai should not be the one responsible for lyrics generation, it goal 
should just be to cleanup extracted text from teseractjs image, and generate prompt for suno to generate song based on mode (sad , savage, meme etc)
