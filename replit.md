## AI Integration

### Suno AI Music Generation
The app uses Suno AI (via third-party API providers) for professional music generation:

**Required Environment Variables:**
```
SUNO_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

**Integration Flow:**
1. User provides breakup story (text or screenshot)
2. OCR extracts text from screenshot (if applicable)
3. OpenRouter/LLM generates song lyrics and metadata
4. Suno AI generates the actual music
5. Song is stored in database with preview and full URLs

**Implementation:** See `lib/suno.ts` for the Suno API client

### OpenRouter LLM Integration
The app uses OpenRouter to access Claude 3.5 Sonnet for intelligent prompt generation:

**Required Environment Variables:**
```
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

**Purpose:**
- Converts raw breakup stories into structured song lyrics
- Generates song titles and genre/style tags
- Optimizes prompts for Suno AI music generation

**Implementation:** See `lib/openrouter.ts` for the OpenRouter API client

### Tesseract.js OCR
Extracts text from chat screenshots using client-side OCR:
- Implementation: `lib/ocr.ts`
- API endpoint: `/api/ocr`
- No API key required (runs in-browser)

## User Preferences
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Smooth animations using Framer Motion
- Heartbreak color palette (pale red, white, gray)
- Rounded, friendly fonts
- No placeholder data - production-ready code

## Dependencies
```json
{
  "@paddle/paddle-js": "^1.5.1",
  "next": "^16.0.3",
  "react": "^19.2.0",
  "tailwindcss": "^4.1.17",

  "react-icons": "^5.5.0",
  "react-h5-audio-player": "^3.10.1",
  "clsx": "^2.1.1"
}
```

## Development
- Dev server runs on port 5000 (required for Replit webview)
- All hosts allowed for iframe compatibility
- TypeScript strict mode enabled

## Complete Workflow

### Song Generation Flow
1. **User Input**: User enters breakup story as text OR uploads chat screenshot
2. **OCR Processing** (if screenshot): Tesseract.js extracts text from image
3. **LLM Generation**: OpenRouter (Claude 3.5) converts story into:
   - Song title
   - Genre/style tags
   - Full lyrics (200-400 words)
4. **Music Generation**: Suno AI creates the actual song (30-60 seconds)
5. **Preview Display**: User sees:
   - Animated lyrics overlay
   - Custom audio player
   - Animated background with floating elements
   - Social share buttons
6. **Sharing**: Users can share song on TikTok, Instagram, WhatsApp, Twitter

### Technical Features
- **Mobile-first responsive design** with Tailwind CSS
- **Smooth animations** using Framer Motion
- **Lyrics scrolling** synchronized to song duration (60s default)
- **CSS-only animations** for background (no video generation)
- **Export functionality** (premium feature - locked)
- **AI Breakup Advice** (premium feature - upsell in UI)

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Suno AI and OpenRouter integration complete
2. Set up Paddle products and prices in dashboard
3. Configure webhook endpoint for subscription events
4. Test payment flow in sandbox mode
5. Add user authentication for song history
6. Implement download functionality for purchased songs
7. Test complete OCR → LLM → Suno workflow with real API keys
