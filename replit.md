## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The application features a dark theme using almost black (#0f0f0f), hot pink (#ff006e), and gold (#ffd23f) for a club/revenge party aesthetic. The design is mobile-first with bold, aggressive typography (font-black throughout). Key visual elements include a neon gradient logo, solid CTA buttons with strong glows, and enhanced visibility for emojis and icons. Animated features like neon spark storms, confetti explosions, and a fast typewriter effect for headlines contribute to a dynamic and engaging user experience. Subtle tooltips replace intrusive onboarding, and all elements are optimized for performance with GPU acceleration where possible.

### Technical Implementations
The frontend is built with **Next.js 16 App Router**, utilizing **Tailwind CSS** for styling and **Framer Motion** for animations. The application is entirely **Drizzle ORM-only** for database interactions, with Prisma having been completely removed.
Core features include:
- **Song Generation Flow**: User input (text or screenshot) leads to LLM-generated prompts by OpenRouter, followed by music generation via Suno AI.
- **Retention Features**: Includes daily savage text quotes and personalized 15-20 second Suno AI audio nudges with lo-fi trap/hype beats, delivered via opt-in mechanisms.
- **Credit System**: Implemented for managing access to audio nudges, with free, one-time, and unlimited tiers.
- **OCR Processing**: Tesseract.js is used for text extraction from uploaded chat screenshots.
- **Lyrics Overlay**: Smooth-scrolling lyrics synchronized with song playback.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Sub-1 second load times, GPU-accelerated animations, and lazy-loaded assets.

### Feature Specifications
